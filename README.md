# The electric consumption of houses

Leveraging the dataset located here:
https://www.eia.gov/consumption/residential/data/2009/index.php?view=microdata, I built a model that predicts the electric
consumption of housings. The electric
consumption is located in the KWH field.

The notebook consists of 3 parts:

1. Data Engineering
2. Machine Learning Solution
3. Analysing the results
